# Gender-Gap-In-Tech

Over the years, there’s been an increase in the contribution of women in the work force all around the world. The percentage of working women in the United States alone has climbed to 46.8%, far higher than it was a few decades ago. However, these numbers are significantly lower in the tech sector:
- •	74% of girls express a desire for a career in STEM fields.
-  •	26% of all computing related jobs are held by women.
-  •	Almost half of tech-educated women who have children go on to leave their job.

From the above statistics, it could be observed that the tech industry is dominated by male. However, we will try to look on what is the cause and how we can possibly bridge it.
Steps:
In this project,  I only make use of the 'multiple_choice_responses.csv' file 2019 Kaggle ML and DS Survey .
Point to note: I am aware that this data was only collected from (19717)respondents, and that this sample population is not representative of the entire population. However, it gives us a good idea of the actual population and is the closest we can get to the true population.
